With the return of the Raptors, the Wingless of Raven's Vale were rewarded by the victorious Harab Seraphs. The old ice temples were replaced by mausoleums of stone and iron and the Wingless were placed as guardians of these new temples. New sacred orders were formed and the Blizzard Warriors were replaced by the Iron Hail Warriors who were bereft of flight, not as an act of will, but as an act of divine intervention. The Iron Hail Warriors draw strength from the earth and are reinvigorated as long as they touch the ground.
