Blessed units receive increased morale and additional powers if their god is powerful enough to claim a divine title. For example, Fire gods bless their soldiers with battle prowess and gods of Nature bless their holy warriors with berserker rage. The blessing lasts the entire battle."

153	Smite Demon	7	0	8	2	-1	0	760	1	100	0	0	0	This prayer will make a divine bolt strike down from the sky and deliver massive damage to a demon who fails to resist the spell. This prayer is a great compliment to banishment as it is much more powerful against single demons.

162	Freezing Touch	2	0	2	1	-1	0	769	1	0	10	0	0	"The mage touches an enemy who will suffer from severe freezing damage, possibly even die from it. This is an effective spell because armor offers no protection against this quite potent attack. On the other hand, it might be very hard to actually touch an enemy in the heat of battle."
163	Flying Shards	2	0	3	1	-1	0	770	2002	0	30	0	0	"The caster hurls several stones towards enemy units. The shards are not very powerful, but can severely injure lightly armored units. The number of shards hurled depends on the skill of the caster."
164	Twist Fate	1	0	4	1	-1	0	771	1	0	10	0	0	The caster changes his future fate. Twist Fate negates the first successful strike against the one protected by this spell.
165	Hand of Dust	1	0	5	1	-1	0	772	1	0	10	0	0	"The caster's left hand becomes deadly, able to turn anything it touches to ashes. The spell is limited in power but ignores armor."

167	Bleed	6	0	7	1	-1	0	774	1	0	0	1	0	"The Bleed spell causes blood to pour out of the victim's nose, ears and mouth. The effect is a prolonged and painful death. Magic resistance can negate the effect."
168	Monster Boar	0	5	6	3	-1	0	775	1	0	0	10	0	The caster summons a monster boar and sends it to a distant province to ravage the land. The boar is a descendant of the monster boars sent by the Lady of the Hunt to ravage the farmlands of obnoxious peasants. The boar will cause unrest in the province until it is found and slain.
169	Orgy	6	1	7	1	6	1	776	1	0	0	1	87	"The reveler organizes a wild orgy in the woods with the sacrifice of a virgin as the climactic finale. The orgy will attract a satyr intent on uninhibited fornication. During the orgy six women will be struck by the madness of the wild, shedding all clothes and civilized manners and turning to the wild as raging maenads. The satyr will remain after the orgy to lure more women into the wild."
170	Daughter of Typhon	0	9	6	5	5	2	777	1	0	0	30	0	"The mage enters the misty swamps of Pythia to find the entrance to the underworld hidden there. Once there the mage will lure and bind the guardian of the gate to his service. The guardian is a beast of might and malice unequaled. She is the daughter of Typhon, Enemy of Gods, and Echidna, Mother of Monsters and her name is Hydra. Like her lesser kin, she has nine heads. However, her central head is blessed by her father and is immortal. Should it be cut off a new body will regrow from the stump within weeks. Hydra is sacred."

The flame storm will strike an enemy army camp within the province with enormous force.

While projected, the caster will only be able to sense and affect magic, but this still makes it possible to search for magic sites and enemy mages. The caster will be able to project himself into all provinces that have a friendly Dominion. Magic sites are more elusive when searching in this way and a very powerful mage is required to find those that are well hidden. Mages are usually able to stay hidden from the projected mind if they have a good magic resistance value. If an Astral mage is found, a battle of the minds will ensue. Only one will leave it with their mind intact. Other mages cannot try to retaliate, but neither do they risk losing their sanity in the process. However, they will be subjected to a minor Mind Burn attack if they are found. The enchantment lasts until the caster is killed or feebleminded or the enchantment is dispelled."

504	Earth Grip	1	1	3	1	-1	0	1111	1	5	10	0	0	"The mage orders the earth to swallow a single target. If the target is affected, he will be unable to move unless he succeeds in breaking free."

579	Iron Pigs	1	6	3	3	6	1	1186	7	0	0	10	0	"The caster transforms seven ordinary boars into beings of flesh and steel. People do not like to be permanently transformed and would probably revolt against masters that tried to curse them with iron bodies. Pigs, on the other hand, are not bothered, or at least they don't complain. Pigs are also preferred to dogs, as they have the size and strength to trample human-sized opponents. The transformation does not make the pigs braver."
580	Control	1	6	4	3	-1	0	1187	1	100	0	1	0	"The caster alters the magical bonds of a magical being, making it serve him instead of its creator."

590	Prison of Sedna	1	7	2	3	-1	0	1197	1	100	0	1	0	"The caster transforms the water surrounding the enemies into ice. The encased targets are protected from strikes, but must break free to be able to move or defend themselves. While encased they will become chilled and numbed and suffer fatigue."
591	Sea of Ice	1	7	2	6	-1	0	1198	1	0	0	80	0	"All lakes, seas and rivers in the world are frozen by this powerful enchantment.

All provinces in friendly dominion will be affected by the fata morgana. The enchantment lasts until it is dispelled or the caster dies.
603	Quickening	1	8	2	2	-1	0	1210	1	0	0	1	0	"This spells grants quickness to a large number of units. Quickness increases the speed and ability to dodge of the quickened one.
