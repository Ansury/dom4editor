A short scepter whose head bears the likeness of the head a cockerel, wrought in gold and orichalcum. The cockerel scepter, bearing the semblance of the herald of dawn, has great powers versus the forces of night. Anyone struck by the weapon runs the risk of being permanently blinded by the scepter and undead struck will suffer tremendous damage. The scepter can also be called on to call the holy flames of the House of Just Fires.
