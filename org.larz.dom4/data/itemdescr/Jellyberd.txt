A grotesque polearm in the shape of a runed iron shaft ending in a pulsing reddish jellyfish, trailing stinging tendrils. Those who have seen it wielded by the Illithids have dubbed it the jellyberd. When swung the tendrils will flail about and will not just hit the the primary target but it will strike anyone standing close to the target as well, paralyzing and poisoning those struck. The jellyfish protects its wielder with an astral force.
