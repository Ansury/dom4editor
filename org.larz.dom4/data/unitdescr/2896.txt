When the first Mictlan colony was founded beneath the sea, former atlantians immigrated to the safety of the citadel in the deep. Rain Warriors and Rain Priests from the jungles of Mictlan were the first to settle in the deeps, but soon other atlantians previously hiding in gorges and deep kelp forests flocked to the call of the colony's founders. These atlantians have a darker complexion than the ones from Mictlan. While some of the returned ones have become priests and rulers, there are many old atlantians who are satisfied with status as mighty warriors. They call themselves the Returned and have gained considerable status in the underwater parts of the kingdom.
