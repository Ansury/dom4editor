Peltasts are light Therodian infantry armed with javelins and spears, recruited in new-founded Therodian colonies. In the rich lands of ancient Therodos most soldiers were given iron armors, but a few Peltasts and archers would often accompany the hoplites. Today, due to fewer resources, the use of Peltasts is more common.
