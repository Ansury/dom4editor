The Seraphines are female priests of the ice temples where they conduct services and tend the frost flowers of the ice gardens. Each frost flower is said to hold the soul of a dead Caelian and there is rumor of a hidden garden of ashen flowers in Raven's Vale. The Seraphines perform the horrible ceremony of wing cutting and lead the Temple Guards into battle. Seraphines sometimes set up secret cults in human lands. Their wings and beauty allow them to present themselves as angels and divine messengers.
