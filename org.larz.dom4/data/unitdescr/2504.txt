The Zots are often called the bat people. They resemble small humans with heads and wings of a bat. It is said that the Zotz once came from Xibalba, a great cavernous realm underneath the forests of Mictlan. The Zotz live in caverns and are rarely seen on the surface world. Their legends tell of a time when they were the guardians of the Sun and the Moon during their daily passage through Xibalba.
